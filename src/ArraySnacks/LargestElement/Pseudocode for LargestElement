Pseudocode for finding the largest element in a list

Create an array and initialize it with integer elements

Set the element at the first index of the array to be the largest

If the element in the next index is larger than the current largest, 
	that element becomes the current largest
	Repeat this until the end of the array
Wrap the set of actions in lines 3 - 9 in a method and return the largest element in the list

Pseudocode for Lcm Of Two Numbers

Initialize a variable "multiple" to begin from 2 to avoid zero division error
Prompt user to enter two whole numbers
Read in both numbers
Store each input as "firstNumber" and "secondNumber" respectively
While variable multiple is less than or equal to 1000 and not equal to either of both numbers
	If multiple leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by both numbers
		print "multiple" and terminate the loop
	increment "multiple" by 1 step

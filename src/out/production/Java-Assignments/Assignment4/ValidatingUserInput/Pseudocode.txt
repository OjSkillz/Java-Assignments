Pseudocode for Validating User Input for 10 student results

Initialize passes to zero
initialize failures to zero
Initialize student counter to one
	Prompt user to enter the next exam result as 1 for pass and 2 for fail 
	Input the next exam result
If the value entered by the user is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user complies
Else, go on to evaluating the value input

	if the student passes, 
		add one to passes
	else 
		add one to failures
	Increment student counter by 1 step
	
	While student counter is less than or equal to 10

Display the number of passes
Display the number of failures

If more than  eight students passed
	Display "Bonus to instructor!"

STAGE 1

1. Prompt and collect the amount of water in kilograms
2. Prompt and collect the initial and final temperatures of the water
3. Calculate the energy needed inn Joules
4. Display the energy needed as the result.

STAGE 2

1. Prompt user to input the amount of water in kilograms
2. Collect input
3. Store as "amountOfWaterInKg"
4. Prompt user to input the initial temperature of the water in degrees celcius
4. Collect input
5. Store as "initialTemperature"
6. Prompt user to input final temperature of the water in degrees celcius
7. Collect input
8. Store as "finalTemperature"
9. Calculate the energy needed using the formula: amountOfWaterInKg * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature ) * 4184 
10. Store the result of the calculation as "energyNeeded"
11. Display the result

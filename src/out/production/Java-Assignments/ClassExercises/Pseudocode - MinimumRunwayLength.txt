STAGE 1:

1. Prompt and collect velocity and acceleration of the airplane
2. Calculate the minimum runway length
3. Display the result

STAGE 2

1. Prompt the user to input the velocity of the airplane in m/s
2. Collect input 
3. Store as "velocity"
4. Prompt the user to input the acceleration of the airplane in m/s2
5. Collect input 
6. Store as "acceleration" 
7. Calculate the minimum runway length using the formula (velocity *velocity) / (2  * acceleration)
8. Store result as "length"
9. Display the result

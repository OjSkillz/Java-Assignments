Create an array and initialize it with integer elements 

Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a for loop :
	Initialize a variable "sum" to hold the sum of the elements of the array
	For each iteration equalling the number of elements in the array
		update sum by adding each element of the array

Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a while loop :
	Initialize a variable "sum" to hold the sum of the elements of the array
	Initialize a counter of elements in the array
	While the counter is less than the length of the array
		update sum by adding each element of the array
	Increment the counter of elements in the array by 1 step

Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a do-while loop :
	Initialize a variable "sum" to hold the sum of the elements of the array
	Initialize a counter of elements in the array
	Update sum by adding the first element of the array
	Repeat that operation while counter is less than the length of the array

Print the value of "sum" for each loop computation

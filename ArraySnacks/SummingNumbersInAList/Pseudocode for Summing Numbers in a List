Create an array and initialize it with integer elements 
Initialize a variable "sum" to hold the sum of the elements of the array
Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a for loop :
	For each iteration equalling the number of elements in the array
		update sum by adding each element of the array

Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a while loop :
	While the number of elements in the array are not exhausted
		update sum by adding each element of the array
	Increment the counter of elements in the array

Compute the sum of the elements of the array using a do-while loop :
	Update sum by adding the first element of the array
	Repeat that operation while there is still an element in the array

Print the value of "sum" for each loop computation

2. Solving Quadratic Equations

Pseudocode:

1. Read in the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation from a user
2. Use coefficients a, b and c to solve the quadratic equation using the formula:
	x = (-b +- (b^2 - 4ac)^0.5) / 2a
	where the expression on the right evaluates to two values of x roots of the
	equation
	
3. Display the two roots of the equation based on the following conditions:
	- if (b^2 - 4ac), known as the determinant is greater than 0 (for which there will
	be two real roots)
	- if (b^2 - 4ac) is less than 0 (for which there will be two complex roots)
	- if (b^2 - 4ac) is equal to 0 (for which there will be one real solution 
	repeated)
